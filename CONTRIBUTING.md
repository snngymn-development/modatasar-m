   git clone https://github.com/your-username/enterprise-flutter-project.git
   cd enterprise-flutter-project
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   dart run build_runner build
   ```

3. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   flutter test

   ```

## Coding Standards

### Dart/Flutter Standards

- Follow [Dart Style Guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style)
- Use [Flutter Lints](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_lints)
- Maintain 100% test coverage
- Write self-documenting code

### Architecture Standards

- Follow Clean Architecture principles
- Implement feature-first organization
- Use dependency injection (Riverpod)
- Maintain separation of concerns

### Code Organization

```
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ core/           # Core utilities and infrastructure
â”œâ”€â”€ features/       # Feature modules
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ feature_name/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ data/   # Data layer
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ domain/ # Domain layer
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ presentation/ # Presentation layer
â””â”€â”€ main.dart       # Entry point
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Files**: `snake_case.dart`
- **Classes**: `PascalCase`
- **Variables**: `camelCase`
- **Constants**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- **Private members**: `_camelCase`

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and classes
- **Widget Tests**: Test UI components
- **Integration Tests**: Test complete user flows

### Test Coverage

- Maintain 100% test coverage
- Write tests before implementing features (TDD)
- Test both success and error scenarios
- Mock external dependencies

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run specific test file
flutter test test/unit/features/sales/sale_test.dart

# Run with coverage
flutter test --coverage
```

### Feature Requests

When requesting features, please include:

- **Description**: Clear description of the feature
- **Use Case**: Why this feature is needed
- **Proposed Solution**: How you think it should work
- **Alternatives**: Other solutions considered

## Architecture Guidelines

### Clean Architecture

Follow the Clean Architecture principles:

1. **Domain Layer**: Business logic and entities
2. **Data Layer**: Data sources and repositories
3. **Presentation Layer**: UI and state management

### Feature Organization

Each feature should be self-contained:

```
features/feature_name/
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ repositories/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ services/
â”œâ”€â”€ domain/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ entities/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ repositories/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ usecases/
â””â”€â”€ presentation/
    â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
    â”œâ”€â”€ widgets/
    â””â”€â”€ providers/
```

### State Management

Use Riverpod for state management:

- **Providers**: For dependency injection
- **StateNotifier**: For complex state
- **Consumer**: For UI consumption

### Error Handling

Implement comprehensive error handling:

- **Result Pattern**: For operations that can fail
- **Failure Classes**: For different error types
- **Global Error Handler**: For unhandled errors

## Code Review Process

### Review Checklist

- [ ] Code follows architecture guidelines

- [ ] Security implications considered

### Review Guidelines

- Be constructive and helpful
- Focus on code quality and architecture
- Suggest improvements, don't just point out problems
- Approve when all criteria are met

## Release Process

### Version Numbering

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MINOR**: New features (backward compatible)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes (backward compatible)

### Release Checklist
